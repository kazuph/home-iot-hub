# Home Assistant BLE to MQTT Hub.

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/Chylynsky/home-iot-hub/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chylynsky/home-iot-hub/actions)

## About

This project aims in allowing seamless connection between Home Assistant MQTT integration and BLE devices.
It is supposed to run on ESP32 boards supporting both WiFi and BLE. 

## Requirements

The project runs on a single ESP32 board. It requires building, so ESP-IDF enviroment is needed (go to Espressif github page for configuration steps). Also, you will need Home Assistant up and running along with the MQTT integration.
